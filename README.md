Computational Graphics/OpenGL

I think, at the end of it all, the knowledge of 3d rendering will be a tremendous boost to my career and toolbox. I learned so much in this course, and I'm excited to see where this foundation takes me. In particular, I will say it helped me refine even further my skill with object oriented design, and that's how I tried to approach this project. That will definitely aid me in future work. Throughout the milestones, I struggle dto really understand how everything was working together. It was, frankly, confusing and left me more than a little frustrated. However, by the end, I began to understand how it all came together and utilized that knowledge to make a working, finished product. So far, I've really only known how to make text based interfaces for my programs. I've dabbled some in other tools to overcome that, but openGL may be the most powerful one yet. The ability to create an interactive world opens so many doors for me. I love game design, but also just as a usability or appeal factor in more mundane software applications, openGL is going to prove to be very useful. I knowf or sure the skills i learned this term will build in my education as I move forward, and those skill will transfer to my career when I graduate.
